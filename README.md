This research focuses on integrating traditional Ayurvedic medical knowledge with modern Artificial Intelligence through systematic data standardization. The study implements NLP and machine learning techniques (BERT, CNN, and Naïve Bayes) to classify Ayurvedic text and improve model performance using structured datasets.

Project Highlights:
- Preprocessing unstructured Ayurvedic datasets using NLP
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for identifying herbs, diseases, treatments, and doshas
- Ontology mapping for categorization and standardization
- Model performance comparison: BERT (100%), CNN (80%), Naïve Bayes (50%)

Code:
The Google Colab notebook  includes the full pipeline:
- Dataset preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy & Transformers
- Text classification using:
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - BERT (fine-tuned)
- Ontology mapping via TF-IDF & cosine similarity
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Visuals:
-Ontology Mapping Table-Standardizes Ayurvedic symptoms and categorizes them into DISEASE, DOSHA, TREATMENT, or UNKNOWN.
-Model Performance Metrics - Comparison of machine learning model results on standardized Ayurvedic data.

Technologies & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
